# TriviaGame
This is an 80's themed trivia game which hides everything except the header and Start button on the initial screen.
When the user clicks the Start button, it is hidden revealing the trivia questions, answer choices, and Submit button.  The timer is also displayed when the Start button is clicked and begins counting down from 30 seconds.
When the user clicks the Submit button, the questions and timer are hidden and the user's score is revealed.
The score shows the total number of questions answered correctly, incorrectly, and unanswered
If the 30 second timer expires before the user clicks the Submit button, the questions and Submit button are hidden and the total number of questions answered correctly, incorrectly, and unanswered is displayed.
